## Data description

To conduct our exploration of the impact of COVID in japan, we will be using multiple datasets (owid-covid-data.csv, recovery.csv, prefecture.csv) for our analysis.
2 of the datasets (prefectures.csv, prefecture.csv) were sourced from Toyo Keizai Online "Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Situation Report in Japan" with its orginal data provided by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan. The owid-covid-data.csv dataset are provided by our world in data with its orginal data sourced from  the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).
No data wrangling and data tidy was conducted as the datasets have already been tided when sourced.
