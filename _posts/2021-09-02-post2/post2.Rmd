## COVID-19 in different prefectures in Japan

```{r}
prefectures <- prefectures_data %>%
  select(c(
  "prefectureNameE",
  "testedPositive",
  "date",
  "year",
  "month")) %>% 
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, date)) %>% 
filter(date == "2021-08-30") 

prefectures_p <-prefectures  %>% 
 select("prefectureNameE",
        "testedPositive") %>% 
arrange(desc(testedPositive)) %>% 
  top_n(6) 
  
  table<-prefectures_p %>% 
    rename(Location = prefectureNameE,
         "Number of postive cases" = testedPositive)

knitr::kable (table,caption = "The top 6 prefecture with the most number of postive cases in Japan") %>% kable_styling()
  

```
From the table, we can see that the top number of postive cases are located in Tokyo (340,665), Osaka (166,378), Kanagawa (146,239), saitama(100,136), Chiba (85,573) and Aichi (82,167 respectively.

```{r prefectures_bargraph}
p_plot <- ggplot(data = prefectures_p, 
                      aes(x = prefectureNameE,
                          y = testedPositive,
                          fill = prefectureNameE)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity",position ="dodge") +
    ggtitle("The top 6 prefecture with the most number of postive cases in Japan") +
   geom_text(aes(label = testedPositive ), vjust =2, colour = "black", size = 2.2) +
  xlab("Number of postive cases") +
  ylab("Prefectures") +
  coord_flip() 
g<- ggplotly(p_plot )
g

```

```{r line_data}
p_plot_data <- prefectures_data %>%
  select(c(
  "prefectureNameE",
  "testedPositive",
  "date",
  "year",
  "month")) %>% 
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, date))

new<- p_plot_data %>%
  select(c(
  "prefectureNameE",
  "testedPositive",
  "date")) %>% 
  filter(prefectureNameE %in% c("Tokyo", "Osaka","Kanagawa","Saitama","Chiba","Aichi")
         )
```

```{r line plot data}
line_plot <- ggplot(data = new, 
                      aes(x = date,
                          y= testedPositive,
                          )) +
    geom_line(aes(color = 
prefectureNameE), size = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("Compare and contrast the number of postive cases for the top 6 prefectures in Japan") +
  xlab ("Date") +
  ylab ("number tested positive")
l<- ggplotly(line_plot)
l
```

From the graph, we can see that the number of postive cases of COIVD-19 for all 6 locations in Japan obtains a increasing trend. All of the prefectures show a rapid surge in the number of confirm Covid-19 cases since mid july 2021 and conintues to increase to end of August 2021. 

## COVID-19 Vaccination in Japan

Now lets have a look at the vaccination status in japan.

```{r vacination}
vac<- japan_data %>% 
  select(c("date",
           "total_vaccinations",
           "people_fully_vaccinated",
           "people_vaccinated",
           "new_vaccinations",
           "population",
           "location")) %>% 
  filter (location == "Japan") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
mutate(full_vacination_rate = sum((people_fully_vaccinated/population)*100, na.rm = TRUE),
         vacination_rate = sum((people_vaccinated/population)*100, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r table}
vac_table <- vac %>%  
  select(c("vacination_rate","full_vacination_rate","date")) %>% 
  filter (date == "2021-08-30" |date == "2021-01-30" | date == "2021-03-30" |date == "2021-04-30" | date == "2021-05-30" |date == "2021-06-30" | date == "2021-07-30")%>% 
    relocate(date,.before = vacination_rate) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header (title = "The Vacination rate in Japan",
              subtitle = "The vacination rate and fully vacination rate 2020 vs 2021 in Japan ") %>% 
 tab_source_note(md("Souced:COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)"))
vac_table

```

From this table, we can see that since January 2021, both vaccination rate and those who have recieved full vaccination rate are increasing. By August 2021 the vaccination rate in Japan arrive at 57% and full vaccination rate arriving ar 0.46%. This indicates that over half of the population have had at least one vaccine dose and nearly half of the population is now fully vaccinated aginst COVID-19. With this table, we can see that with the increase number of vaccination rate, it is suggestive that the government in Japan is taking an active approach by urgenting public to get vaccinated inoroder to  slow down the the spread COVID-19. 


## COVID-19 Recovery in Japan

```{r recovery}
japan_recovery <- recovery_data %>% 
  rename("Number_of_recovery" = "recovery_total") %>%  
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))
```


```{r data}
japan <- japan_data %>%
  select(c("date",
           "total_cases",
           "new_cases",
           "total_deaths",
           "new_deaths",
           "new_tests",
           "total_tests",
           "location")) %>% 
  filter (location == "Japan") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  mutate(percentage_positive_rate = sum(new_cases/new_tests, na.rm = TRUE) )
```

```{r daily_cases}
cases <- japan %>% 
  select (c( "total_cases",
           "new_cases",
           "date",
          "location")) %>% 
  mutate(Date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  relocate(date,.before = total_cases)
```

```{r}
recovery_rate<- japan_recovery %>% 
  left_join(cases, by = "Date") %>% 
  select(c("Date",
           "Number_of_recovery",
           "total_cases")) %>% 
  group_by(Date) %>% 
  mutate(Recovery_rate = sum(Number_of_recovery/total_cases*100))
```

Here we exmaine the COVID-19 recovery by looking at its proportion of recovery by dividing the number of recovery by the total confirm case COVID-19. 
The following interactive table generated contains data of the date, number of recovery total case and the recovery_rate of covid-19 and is provided for data exploration for users. 

```{r interactive_table2}
DT::datatable(recovery_rate, option = list(pageLength = 4))
```

```{r recovery_rate_graph}
recovery_graph<- ggplot(data = recovery_rate, 
                      aes(x = Date,
                          y= Recovery_rate
                          )) +
    geom_line(stat = "identity", size = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("proportion of COVID-19 recovery in Japan from 2020-2021") +
  xlab("Date") + 
  ylab("Percentage of recovery from COVID-19 in Japan") 

recovery_p <-ggplotly(recovery_graph)
recovery_p
```

From the graph, we can see that the proportion of recovery was relatively low from the january 2020 to the april of 2020 with recovery proportion peaking at around 39% and 22%. However by June 2020 to the end of 2020, the proportion of recovery rate has increased drasticially with recovery rate flutuating around 67% to 91%. The increase in recovery rate was again seen from the beginning of 2021 to the end of august 2021, with recovery rate flutuating around 76% to 95%.In conjunction with the previous analysis on vacinnation, it shows that with more and more people getting vaccinated against the virus in 2021, the recovery rate has increased significantly compared 2020 when the vaccination was not yet introduced, thus indicating that that the vaccination does have an effect on COVID-19 recovery rate in Japan. 

**Conclusion**
Base from the analysis we have conducted,  the COVID-19 situation in Japan is not great ,as there appears to be a growing number of confirm daily cases and deaths of COVID-19. However with the introduction of the vaccination in 2021, we also see a huge rise of recovery rate as compare to 2020. Thus we conclude that depsite the increase in the number of postive cases in Japan, the introduction of vaccination has helped to rised the recovery rate thus if vaccination continue to roll out across the country, with sufficient proportion of general public vaccinated, we can expect that the recovery rate will be grow simulatneously and slow down the virus (only if no new mutated COVID-19 variant show up).
