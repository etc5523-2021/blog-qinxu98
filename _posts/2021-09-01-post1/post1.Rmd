## Introduction

Covid-19 is a disease caused by a form of coronavirus that can cause respiratory infections that range from the common cold to more serious diseases.With its strong transmissibility among public, it is true indeed to say that the COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedent challenge to public health across the globe. As the number of cases confirmed with the virus continue to climb around the world, many countries has produced vaccination and urged their people to get vaccinated in attempt to stop the pandemic. Thus, to better understand the virus and its characteristics, we will be examining the the impact COVID-19 pandemic in Japan by first looking the COVID-19 positive rate and death rate in Post-1. Later followed by analysis on recovery rate, vacinnation rate in post 2.

## Data description

To conduct our exploration of the impact of COVID in japan, we will be using multiple datasets (owid-covid-data.csv, recovery.csv, prefecture.csv) for our analysis.
2 of the datasets (prefectures.csv, prefecture.csv) were sourced from Toyo Keizai Online "Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Situation Report in Japan" with its orginal data provided by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan. The owid-covid-data.csv dataset are provided by our world in data with its orginal data sourced from  the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU).
No data wrangling and data tidy was conducted as the datasets have already been tided when sourced. 


## Part 1.COVID-19 situation in Japan 

```{r read_data}
japan_data <- read.csv(here::here("data/owid-covid-data.csv"))
```

```{r data}
japan <- japan_data %>%
  select(c("date",
           "total_cases",
           "new_cases",
           "total_deaths",
           "new_deaths",
           "new_tests",
           "total_tests",
           "location")) %>% 
  filter (location == "Japan") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  mutate(percentage_positive_rate = sum(new_cases/new_tests, na.rm = TRUE) )
```

```{r daily_cases_data}
cases <- japan %>% 
  select (c( "total_cases",
           "new_cases",
           "date",
          "location")) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  relocate(date,.before = total_cases)
```

Here is an interactive table has been provided for your own data exploration, feel free to play around the dataset and use it as a complement to the following analysis in this post. 

```{r interactive_table}
DT::datatable(japan, option = list(pageLength = 4))
```

```{r daily_case_p}
dcasesp_p<- ggplot(data = cases, 
                      aes(x = date,
                          y= new_cases,
                          )) +
    geom_line(stat = "identity", size = 0.5,colour = "#FF9999") +
  geom_point(size = 0.3, colour = "#FF9999") +
    ggtitle("Daily number of COVID-19 confirm cases in Japan from 2020-2021") +
  xlab("Date") + 
  ylab("Daily new cases in Japan") +
   scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")

 dcasesp_p<-ggplotly(dcasesp_p)
dcasesp_p
```
From the plot we can see that the daily number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has increased dratistically from 2020 to 2021. From Janaury 2020 to november 2020 the trend was relatively flat with its peak at around 1500 daily confirmed cases, however by the beginning of 2021 june 20201, we see a huge surge with two peaks at around 7000 confirm cases per day. This increasing in peaks continued as by august 20th 2021 there are over 25000 confirm cases of COVID-19 in Japan per day. This indicates that the COVID-19 continues to rampage in Japan with more and more people catching the diseases. This could due to many reason, one being that the 2020 olypmpic  was held in August 20201 in Japan. In such an event, human gather in celebration of the olympic hence interaction is unavoidable and  as clusters increase  the spread of the disease also increases among the public thus the phenomon shown in this graph.  

```{r Tcases_graph}
tcases_p<- ggplot(data = cases, 
                      aes(x = date,
                          y= total_cases,
                          )) +
    geom_line(stat = "identity", size = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 0.3, colour = "#FF9999") +
    ggtitle("Total number of COVID-19 cases in Japan from 2020-2021") +
  xlab("Date") + 
  ylab("Total posiitve in Japan") +
   scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")

dcases_p <-ggplotly(tcases_p)
dcases_p 
```


```{r daily_death}
death <- japan %>% 
  select (c( "total_deaths",
           "new_deaths",
           "date",
          "location")) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  relocate(date,.before = total_deaths)
```

```{r daily_death_plot}
ddeath_p<- ggplot(data = death, 
                      aes(x = date,
                          y= new_deaths,
                          )) +
    geom_line(stat = "identity", size = 0.5, colour = "#FF9999") +
  geom_point(size = 0.3, colour = "#FF9999") +
    ggtitle("Daily number of COVID-19 Death in Japn from 2020-2021") +
  xlab("Date") + 
  ylab("Daily new death in Japan") +
   scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")+
   theme_minimal()

ddeath_p <-ggplotly(ddeath_p)
ddeath_p  
```

From this plot, we can see that from January 2020 to the end of August 2021, there has been many different flatuations in terms of the number of daily covid-19 deaths in Japan. The first wave reached its peak in May 2020 with a 29 daily cases of COVID-19 death, this number was later reduced to 23 cases of death daily by the second wave in September 2020. However by 2021, we see a greater wave in the number of daily deaths in Japan with the third and forth waves peaking at around 248 and 216 deaths repectively per day. 

```{r Tdeath_graph}
tdeath_p<- ggplot(data = death, 
                      aes(x = date,
                          y= total_deaths,
                          )) +
    geom_line(stat = "identity", size = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 0.3, colour = "#FF9999") +
    ggtitle("Total number of COVID-19 Death in Japn from 2020-2021") +
  xlab("Date") + 
  ylab("Total deaths in Japan") +
   scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme_minimal()

ddeath_p <-ggplotly(tdeath_p)
ddeath_p 
```

From the plot generated, we can see that there is an increasing trend in the number of the COVID-19 death in the Japan. The trend was relatively flat from the 14th of feburary 2020 to the 1st of December 2020, however after that there is a rapid surge in the number of death (first wave of the COVID-19 in japan)  that stopped around 12th of april 2021. However by May 2021, Japan faced a second small wave of the Covid-19 deaths, with its peak of total number of death arriving at 15987 by the end of August 2021. 

From the above analysis on the daily positive cases , daily number of deaths and the total number of COVID-19 deaths in Japan, it can be concluded that the covid-19 situation in Japan are not in the positive light as daily positive cases, the total number of death and daily number death are greater in 2021 than 2020. An possible explanation to this  phenomenon is that, as covid-19 conitues to rampage the world,simultaneosuly the virus itself also continues to mutate into new variants of the virus with stronger fatality rate and tramissibility. Thus, making it more difficult to not catch the virus and ultimately leading to higher number of deaths and number of positive cases in Japan. 

## Part 2.COVID-19 Situation in Japan

 In this section of the blog, we will drive deeper to explore the action that has been taken into account to fight COVID-19 in Japan by looking at it vacinnation rate and also the COVID-19 recovery rate.
 
 
```{r read_data2}
recovery_data <- read.csv(here::here("data/recovery_total.csv"))
prefectures_data <- read.csv(here::here("data/prefectures.csv"))
```
## COVID-19 in different prefectures in Japan

```{r}
prefectures <- prefectures_data %>%
  select(c(
  "prefectureNameE",
  "testedPositive",
  "date",
  "year",
  "month")) %>% 
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, date)) %>% 
filter(date == "2021-08-30") 

prefectures_p <-prefectures  %>% 
 select("prefectureNameE",
        "testedPositive") %>% 
arrange(desc(testedPositive)) %>% 
  top_n(6) 
  
  table<-prefectures_p %>% 
    rename(Location = prefectureNameE,
         "Number of postive cases" = testedPositive)

knitr::kable (table,caption = "The top 6 prefecture with the most number of postive cases in Japan") %>% kable_styling()
  

```
From the table, we can see that the top number of postive cases are located in Tokyo (340,665), Osaka (166,378), Kanagawa (146,239), saitama(100,136), Chiba (85,573) and Aichi (82,167) respectively.

```{r prefectures_bargraph}
p_plot <- ggplot(data = prefectures_p, 
                      aes(x = prefectureNameE,
                          y = testedPositive,
                          fill = prefectureNameE)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity",position ="dodge") +
    ggtitle("The top 6 prefecture with the most number of postive cases in Japan") +
   geom_text(aes(label = testedPositive ), vjust =2, colour = "black", size = 2.2) +
  xlab("Number of postive cases") +
  ylab("Prefectures") +
  coord_flip()+
  theme_minimal()

g<- ggplotly(p_plot)
g

```

```{r line_data}
p_plot_data <- prefectures_data %>%
  select(c(
  "prefectureNameE",
  "testedPositive",
  "date",
  "year",
  "month")) %>% 
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month, date))

new<- p_plot_data %>%
  select(c(
  "prefectureNameE",
  "testedPositive",
  "date")) %>% 
  filter(prefectureNameE %in% c("Tokyo", "Osaka","Kanagawa","Saitama","Chiba","Aichi")
         )
```

```{r line plot_data}
line_plot <- ggplot(data = new, 
                      aes(x = date,
                          y= testedPositive,
                          )) +
    geom_line(aes(color = 
prefectureNameE), size = 0.5) +
    ggtitle("Compare and contrast the number of postive cases for the top 6 prefectures in Japan") +
  xlab ("Date") +
  ylab ("number tested positive")+
  theme_minimal()

l<- ggplotly(line_plot) 
l
```

From the graph, we can see that the number of postive cases of COIVD-19 for all 6 locations in Japan obtains a increasing trend. All of the prefectures show a rapid surge in the number of confirm Covid-19 cases since mid july 2021 and conintues to increase to end of August 2021. 

## COVID-19 Vaccination in Japan

Now lets have a look at the vaccination status in japan.

```{r vacination}
vac<- japan_data %>% 
  select(c("date",
           "total_vaccinations",
           "people_fully_vaccinated",
           "people_vaccinated",
           "new_vaccinations",
           "population",
           "location")) %>% 
  filter (location == "Japan") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
mutate(full_vacination_rate = sum((people_fully_vaccinated/population)*100, na.rm = TRUE),
         vacination_rate = sum((people_vaccinated/population)*100, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r table}
vac_table <- vac %>%  
  select(c("vacination_rate","full_vacination_rate","date")) %>% 
  filter (date == "2021-08-30" |date == "2021-01-30" | date == "2021-03-30" |date == "2021-04-30" | date == "2021-05-30" |date == "2021-06-30" | date == "2021-07-30")%>% 
    relocate(date,.before = vacination_rate) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header (title = "The Vacination rate in Japan",
              subtitle = "The vacination rate and fully vacination rate 2020 vs 2021 in Japan ") %>% 
 tab_source_note(md("Souced:COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU)"))
vac_table

```

From this table, we can see that since January 2021, both vaccination rate and those who have recieved full vaccination rate are increasing. By August 2021 the vaccination rate in Japan arrive at 57% and full vaccination rate arriving ar 0.46%. This indicates that over half of the population have had at least one vaccine dose and nearly half of the population is now fully vaccinated aginst COVID-19. With this table, we can see that with the increase number of vaccination rate, it is suggestive that the government in Japan is taking an active approach by urgenting public to get vaccinated inoroder to  slow down the the spread COVID-19. 


## COVID-19 Recovery in Japan

```{r recovery}
japan_recovery <- recovery_data %>% 
  rename("Number_of_recovery" = "recovery_total") %>%  
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))
```


```{r recovery_data}
japan <- japan_data %>%
  select(c("date",
           "total_cases",
           "new_cases",
           "total_deaths",
           "new_deaths",
           "new_tests",
           "total_tests",
           "location")) %>% 
  filter (location == "Japan") %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  mutate(percentage_positive_rate = sum(new_cases/new_tests, na.rm = TRUE) )
```

```{r daily_cases}
cases <- japan %>% 
  select (c( "total_cases",
           "new_cases",
           "date",
          "location")) %>% 
  mutate(Date = as.Date(date)) %>% 
  relocate(date,.before = total_cases)
```

```{r}
recovery_rate<- japan_recovery %>% 
  left_join(cases, by = "Date") %>% 
  select(c("Date",
           "Number_of_recovery",
           "total_cases")) %>% 
  group_by(Date) %>% 
  mutate(Recovery_rate = sum(Number_of_recovery/total_cases*100))
```

Here we exmaine the COVID-19 recovery by looking at its proportion of recovery by dividing the number of recovery by the total confirm case COVID-19. 
The following interactive table generated contains data of the date, number of recovery total case and the recovery_rate of covid-19 and is provided for data exploration for users. 

```{r interactive_table2}
DT::datatable(recovery_rate, option = list(pageLength = 4))
```

```{r recovery_rate_graph}
recovery_graph<- ggplot(data = recovery_rate, 
                      aes(x = Date,
                          y= Recovery_rate
                          )) +
    geom_line(stat = "identity", size = 0.5, colour = "#FF9999") +
    ggtitle("Percentage of COVID-19 recovery in Japan from 2020-2021") +
  xlab("Date") + 
  ylab("Percentage of recovery from COVID-19 in Japan") +
  theme_minimal()
  

recovery_p <-ggplotly(recovery_graph)
recovery_p
```

From the graph, we can see that the proportion of recovery was relatively low from the january 2020 to the april of 2020 with recovery proportion peaking at around 39% and 22%. However by June 2020 to the end of 2020, the proportion of recovery rate has increased drasticially with recovery rate flutuating around 67% to 91%. The increase in recovery rate was again seen from the beginning of 2021 to the end of august 2021, with recovery rate flutuating around 76% to 95%.In conjunction with the previous analysis on vacinnation, it shows that with more and more people getting vaccinated against the virus in 2021, the recovery rate has increased significantly compared 2020 when the vaccination was not yet introduced, thus indicating that that the vaccination does have an effect on COVID-19 recovery rate in Japan. 

**Conclusion**
Base from the analysis we have conducted,  the COVID-19 situation in Japan is not great ,as there appears to be a growing number of confirm daily cases and deaths of COVID-19. However with the introduction of the vaccination in 2021, we also see a huge rise of recovery rate as compare to 2020. Thus we conclude that depsite the increase in the number of postive cases in Japan, the introduction of vaccination has helped to rised the recovery rate thus if vaccination continue to roll out across the country, with sufficient proportion of general public vaccinated, we can expect that the recovery rate will be grow simulatneously and slow down the virus (only if no new mutated COVID-19 variant show up).
